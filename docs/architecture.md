# BranchBrew ERP — Architecture

How BranchBrew ERP is put together, and why. This is the deep-dive companion to the [project README](../README.md) — read that first for the one-page overview.

## Goals and non-goals

**Goals.** One rule drove the design: if two numbers in the system can drift apart, the design is wrong. Concretely — the ledger, stock levels, loyalty balances, and realtime state must be written from the same committed facts; consistency is allowed to be _delayed_ but never _wrong_. Second goal: every hard claim (no lost events, no negative stock, no cross-branch reads) is enforced by the database or proven by a test, not by discipline.

**Non-goals.** Multi-region scale, sub-second ledger latency, and infrastructure beyond one Postgres — this is a portfolio-scale deployment, and [Deliberate trade-offs](#deliberate-trade-offs) lists what was knowingly cut (partial refunds, input VAT, weighted-average costing) and why.

**Why one service and one database, not microservices:** the core guarantee — a business write and its events commit atomically — requires a single transaction boundary. Splitting services turns "the ledger can never disagree with operations" into a distributed-transactions problem, bought before any scale demands it. The module DAG below is what keeps the monolith modular instead of monolithic.

## Module map

The backend is organized as NestJS feature modules with zero `forwardRef` — the dependency graph is a DAG.

| Domain       | Modules                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sales        | `orders`, `products`, `modifiers`, `promotions`, `customers` (CRM loyalty)                            |
| Supply chain | `inventory`, `ingredients`, `procurement`, `production` (central kitchen BOM)                         |
| Back office  | `hr`, `finance`, `accounting`, `reports`, `equipment`, `settings`, `audit`                            |
| Platform     | `auth`, `branches`, `notifications`, `outbox`, `realtime`, `navigation`, `common`, `config`, `prisma` |

The schema behind these modules — core ERD and the invariants the database itself enforces — is in [data-model.md](data-model.md).

## Where to start reading the code

The fastest path through ~77k lines, following one sale from POS to ledger:

1. [`backend/src/orders/order-creation.service.ts`](../backend/src/orders/order-creation.service.ts) — the heart of the system in one file: a single transaction validates the order, deducts ingredient batches FEFO, and enqueues the outbox events that everything downstream runs on.
2. [`backend/src/outbox/outbox.processor.ts`](../backend/src/outbox/outbox.processor.ts) — claims `PENDING` events in a drain loop until the queue is empty, reclaims events stranded by a dead worker via their stale `claimedAt`, and dispatches through the validated registry in [`outbox-event.registry.ts`](../backend/src/outbox/outbox-event.registry.ts).
3. [`backend/src/accounting/accounting.service.ts`](../backend/src/accounting/accounting.service.ts) — the `@OnEvent` handlers that turn domain events into balanced journal entries, deduping on the unique `reference` so at-least-once delivery never double-posts.
4. [`backend/src/auth/branch-scope.util.ts`](../backend/src/auth/branch-scope.util.ts) — the one authorization primitive every branch-owned endpoint resolves through.
5. The tests that prove the hard claims: [`order-void-concurrency.e2e-spec.ts`](../backend/test/order-void-concurrency.e2e-spec.ts) (racing voids against real Postgres), [`outbox-stale-claim.e2e-spec.ts`](../backend/test/outbox-stale-claim.e2e-spec.ts) (recovery from a worker that dies mid-dispatch), and the cross-branch 403 in [`finance.e2e-spec.ts`](../backend/test/finance.e2e-spec.ts).

Money math lives in [`common/decimal.util.ts`](../backend/src/common/decimal.util.ts) and [`common/vat.util.ts`](../backend/src/common/vat.util.ts). On the frontend, start at `frontend/src/lib/query-keys/` (cache invalidation map) and `useKdsSocketSync` (realtime cache patching).

## Transactional outbox

The core reliability decision in the system. The POS never writes journal entries, awards points, or pushes WebSocket frames directly. Instead:

1. A business write (order placed, PO received, production completed, stocktake approved, payroll approved) commits **together with an outbox event row in the same database transaction**.
2. A dispatcher picks up committed events and fans them out to handlers: accounting, loyalty, notifications, and the realtime gateway.
3. Each event payload is checked by a runtime validator before a handler runs, so a malformed event fails loudly instead of posting garbage.

Delivery is **at-least-once** through both crash windows: an event that commits but never dispatches stays `PENDING`, and one whose worker dies mid-dispatch is reclaimed once its `claimedAt` stamp goes stale. Redelivery is harmless because the ledger dedupes on a unique natural `reference`. The consequence: side effects can be delayed, but they can never desync from committed state. There is no scenario where an order exists but its journal entry _silently_ never will — the worst case is an event that exhausts its five attempts and lands in `FAILED`, which is visible in logs but not yet alerted on (see the hardening roadmap below).

Throughput is a measured property, not an assumption. A k6 load test caught the original processor — one batch of 10 events every 10 seconds — draining at exactly 1.00 events/sec while the till sold 20 orders/sec, leaving the ledger nine and a half minutes behind after a 30-second rush. Applying an event costs a median of 2 ms, so the ceiling was the schedule, not the work: the processor was busy 0.3% of the time.

Three changes, each one forced by the last:

1. **Drain, don't sip.** The processor now claims batch after batch until the queue is empty, instead of one batch per tick. Throughput stops being a function of the poll interval.
2. **A re-entrancy guard.** `@nestjs/schedule` does not prevent a tick from starting while the previous one is still running, and a drain loop on a one-second cron makes overlap the normal case rather than the exception. A single `isDraining` flag keeps exactly one drain in flight; the atomic claim (`updateMany` guarded on `status` + `attempts`) already made concurrent workers safe, so this is about wasted queries, not correctness.
3. **A retry backoff.** A failed dispatch is set back to `PENDING`, so polling ten times faster meant a poison event would burn all five of its attempts in five seconds instead of fifty. Retries now wait 30 seconds, keyed off the `claimedAt` stamp of the last attempt.

Measured after the fix, the drain rate tracks the arrival rate up to the 150 events/sec measured, with lag bounded by the poll interval (p50 0.5 s). The harness is in [loadtest/README.md](../loadtest/README.md); the before-and-after numbers are in the [README's Performance section](../README.md#performance--the-bottleneck-the-load-test-found-and-the-fix).

### Alternatives considered

- **In-process event emitter — the v1 this replaced.** The first version announced a sale with `@nestjs/event-emitter` fired from inside the transaction: the order committed, and the accounting and loyalty listeners ran afterwards on a best-effort basis. A listener that threw — or a process restart at the wrong moment — made the sale real while its journal entry silently never existed. That failure mode is what the outbox exists to close, and living through it is why.
- **Message broker (Kafka / RabbitMQ / BullMQ).** A broker publish cannot join the Postgres transaction, so a broker does not remove the outbox — it sits _behind_ one, adding a second piece of stateful infrastructure to operate. At one service and one database, Postgres itself is a perfectly good queue; a broker earns its place when there are multiple producing services or consumers that need independent scaling, neither of which exists here.
- **`LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`.** Pushing events instead of polling would cut the median lag from 0.5 s to single-digit milliseconds. Rejected: it needs a dedicated connection held outside Prisma's pool, and it does not remove the cron anyway — retries and stale claims still need a periodic sweep, so `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` would be a second delivery path layered on top of the one that already exists. Half a second of lag on a coffee-shop ledger does not buy that.

Known hardening still on the roadmap: an operator replay path for `FAILED` events (terminal today, visible only in logs), jitter on the retry backoff, and payload schema versioning.

## Event-driven double-entry accounting

Every money-moving domain event posts a **balanced** journal entry. The ledger is not a report bolted on afterwards — it is written by the same events that move stock and cash, so the operational numbers and the accounting numbers agree by construction.

| Event                       | Journal entry                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POS sale                    | Revenue split into ex-VAT sales + output VAT liability, plus COGS from the recipe cost          |
| Refund / void               | Reversing entry; deducted batches are restored                                                  |
| PO goods received           | Inventory asset vs accounts payable                                                             |
| Supplier payment            | Settles AP — the AP account balance reconciles to the unpaid-PO list on the aging card          |
| Payroll approved            | Gross pay, withholdings, and net cash                                                           |
| Stocktake variance approved | Shrinkage expense; batches adjusted FEFO                                                        |
| Production completed        | Finished goods at standard cost; any cost variance posts to a dedicated variance account (5030) |

Reporting built on top: P&L trend, AP aging, and a ภ.พ.30-style output VAT report with CSV export.

### Money is never a float

All financial math runs on `Prisma.Decimal` with explicit rounding scales and a half-up tie-break. Journal entries are validated to balance to the cent before they persist. Loyalty-point redemption is clamped to the discount it can actually absorb, and point clawback on refund floors at zero — no negative balances from arithmetic edge cases.

Stock _quantities_ are the exception — see inventory, below.

### Standard costing

Ingredient costs are fixed per unit (`costPerUnit`) rather than recomputed as weighted averages on receipt. That is a deliberate trade-off: it keeps COGS deterministic and demo-friendly, and production honestly posts the difference between standard and actual to the variance account instead of pretending costs are always exact.

## Inventory: batches, FEFO, and the stocktake loop

- Stock lives in **batches** with expiry dates. Deduction is first-expired-first-out (FEFO), so the system uses up the milk that expires tomorrow before the carton delivered today.
- The database enforces `CHECK (stock >= 0)` — negative stock is impossible even under concurrent writes.
- **Blind stocktakes** snapshot expected stock at submit time; approved variances adjust batches FEFO and post shrinkage to the ledger. Physical reality corrects the books through the same audited pipeline as everything else.
- Inter-branch transfers do not reserve stock at request time; acceptance claims the `PENDING` transfer with a conditional update before it moves a single batch, so two simultaneous accepts cannot double-move stock.
- **Quantities are `Float`, not `Decimal`** — the one place binary floating point survives. Repeated fractional deductions can drift `BranchInventory.stock` from `SUM(batches.quantity)`; the column migration and a reconciliation job are on the roadmap. Money is unaffected — costing reads `costPerUnit`, a `Decimal`.

## Authentication and authorization

- **JWT in an httpOnly cookie** — no tokens in localStorage, no XSS token theft surface.
- **Token-version revocation** — each user carries a token version. Logout bumps it, and so does any administrative change to a user's branch, role, or password, so demoting, reassigning, or locking out a user kills their live tokens immediately rather than at expiry.
- **Branch-scoped RBAC** — `SUPER_ADMIN` sees all branches; managers and staff resolve branch-owned queries through a shared branch-scope helper (`resolveBranchId` / `assertBranchAccess`) rather than per-endpoint discipline, and an e2e test proves a cross-branch write is rejected with a 403. `Customer` is chain-level and has no `branchId`, so loyalty lookups are unscoped — any staff account can search any customer's phone. That is a privacy gap rather than an intent; scoping it and logging reads of personal data are the top PDPA items on the roadmap.
- Login is IP-throttled rather than account-locked, because the demo credentials are public and lockout would let strangers lock reviewers out.

## Typed contract across the stack

The API contract is a build artifact, not a convention:

1. The backend exports `openapi.json` from its Swagger decorators.
2. The frontend generates its client types (`api.d.ts`) from that file.
3. Shared enums in `packages/types` are generated from the Prisma schema.
4. **CI fails if any generated artifact drifts** from its source.

A backend change that breaks the frontend is a compile error and a red pipeline, not a runtime surprise.

## Frontend architecture

- Next.js 16 App Router with a server-layout auth gate — unauthenticated users never render an app shell.
- TanStack Query 5 for server state, with race-safe optimistic updates.
- A typed `ApiError` envelope (error code + request ID) flows from the backend's exception filter into the client.
- Realtime KDS over socket.io with a live connection badge and reconnect toasts.
- Design tokens and form conventions are documented in [design-system.md](design-system.md).

## Testing strategy

432 tests, split by what each layer can actually prove:

| Suite                     | Tests | What it proves                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend unit (Jest)       | 220   | Money math and rounding ties, order lifecycle, concurrent-claim guards, outbox reclaim, accounting postings                |
| Backend e2e (supertest)   | 20    | Auth, orders, branch scoping, concurrent order voids, and outbox recovery from a dead worker — all against a real Postgres |
| Frontend unit (Vitest)    | 177   | Validators, filters, VAT parity with the backend, API client behavior                                                      |
| Frontend e2e (Playwright) | 15    | Login, full POS checkout, KDS, axe accessibility smoke                                                                     |

CI additionally runs type-checks, lint, coverage thresholds, a Docker Compose smoke test of the full stack, Trivy image scans, and the generated-artifact drift checks above.

## Deployment

A commit reaches the live demo in minutes, with no manual step:

| Trigger                                        | What runs                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git push`                                     | A husky pre-push hook runs the local gate — type-check, lint, and both unit suites. The e2e suites need a database and a running stack, so they are CI's job    |
| Push to `main`                                 | GitHub Actions CI runs; **in parallel**, Vercel rebuilds the frontend and Render rebuilds the API image (`autoDeploy: true` in [`render.yaml`](../render.yaml)) |
| Push to `main` touching `prisma/migrations/**` | [`migrate-demo.yml`](../.github/workflows/migrate-demo.yml) applies pending migrations to the Supabase demo database and fails if any remain pending            |
| Every 3 hours                                  | [`refresh-demo.yml`](../.github/workflows/refresh-demo.yml) reseeds the Supabase demo database so today's sales, orders, and kitchen tickets stay live          |

The frontend is a Vercel project rooted at `frontend/`; the API is a Docker service built from `backend/Dockerfile`. Both talk to the same managed Postgres. The wiring that makes a split-domain deploy work — the same-origin `/backend` rewrite that keeps the auth cookie first-party, the pooler-vs-direct connection, free-tier cold starts — is documented in [infra/README.md](../infra/README.md).

**Trade-off — deploys are not gated on CI.** Vercel and Render start building the moment a commit lands on `main`, in parallel with the CI workflow rather than after it, so CI reports on a deploy that is already happening. The practical gate is the pre-push hook: type-check, lint and the unit suites must pass locally before anything reaches `main`. That is sufficient for a single maintainer but not for a team, because a hook is local and can be bypassed with `--no-verify`. Gating properly means disabling both platforms' auto-deploy and firing their deploy hooks from a CI job that `needs:` the test jobs — a deliberate next step rather than an oversight.

**Trade-off — the deploy does not run migrations.** Render starts the API image directly, and `migrate-demo.yml` applies migrations on push in parallel with that build rather than before it. So **migrations must stay backward-compatible with the deployed code** — additive columns and indexes, never a rename or a drop in the same release.

## Deliberate trade-offs

Choices made knowingly for a portfolio-scale deployment, with the reasoning:

- **No account lockout** — see [auth](#authentication-and-authorization) above.
- **Standard costing, no weighted average** — see [standard costing](#standard-costing) above; partial PO receipt is likewise out of scope.
- **Whole-order refunds only** — partial refunds multiply the accounting reversal cases without demonstrating a new concept.
- **Output VAT only** — sales post VAT to a liability account; input VAT on purchases is out of scope for the demo.
- **No promotion usage limits** — promo codes validate eligibility but not redemption counts.

Roadmap beyond demo scale: pagination across all list endpoints (audit and auth already paginate), branch-scoping and read-auditing for customer records, end-to-end `Decimal` stock quantities with a scheduled reconciliation between branch stock and batch-level quantities, outbox hardening (an operator replay path, jitter on the retry backoff), and metrics with an alert on failed outbox events.
